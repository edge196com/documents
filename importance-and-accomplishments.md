# Importance & Accomplishments

Crypto assets are known for their high volatility which renders them unsuitable for the medium of exchange. A stable cryptocurrency strives to become a medium of exchange by suppressing volatility and maintaining a constant value through time. This innovation allows individuals and businesses to enter into future agreements at a known cost. Just as one US Dollar today is equal to one dollar tomorrow, people can transact knowing they will have a certain fixed cost.

The USDAO Stablecoin System has been operating in Beta mode since its launch on testnet in July 2021. The Beta mode allows for a single collateral type, Ether. Soon will be available on mainnet. 

Stay tuned for future updates. Follow USDAO on all leading social media platforms.

## Next

Multi-Collateral USDAO is the next and full version of the USDAO Stablecoin System. In this system, all ERC-20 tokens are capable of being used as collateral for USDAO. Governance token \(DGOV\) holders will be responsible for voting in and setting risk parameters for each collateral type. The scope of collateral types is as wide as tokens issued on the Ethereum platform. IN addition to it USDAO protocol will be available on all the major blockchains.

Please check the road map for future updates and developments.
