  project depending on your business goals.

# USDAO Stack

There are, however, core technologies of USDAO that help provide a model for how software applications interact with the USDAO stable coin. Understanding the layers of the stack will help you understand the different ways that USDAO can be integrated into different projects.

### Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts are self-executable programs running on the blockchain. Smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman.

### USDAO APIS

Many convenience libraries \(built and maintained by USDAO's open-source community\) allow your end-user applications to connect to and communicate with the Ethereum blockchain.

### End User Applications

At the top level of the stack are user-facing applications. These are the standard applications you regularly use and build today: primarily web and mobile apps.

The way you develop these user interfaces remains essentially unchanged. Often users will not need to know the application they're using is built using a blockchain.
