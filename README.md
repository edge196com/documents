# Overview

USDAO is a fully crypto asset-backed stable currency by USDAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A digital token intended to serve as a global currency. USDAO brings together familiar concepts into a never-before-seen protocol.

## Introduction

In order to create a stable coin that meets the requirements of businesses and enterprises, it is important that not only it is competent enough against traditional solutions but also present significant improvements over them. We offer USDAO stable coin as a solution to the above problem. USDAO stable coin has been designed to keep simplicity, interoperability, and business compatibility at its core. IntegratingUSDAO as a payment channel into your existing business or enterprise use case is simpler than the leading payment solutions available today. All you need is a blockchain wallet with an account to send and receive payments in USDAO to get started. The process is simpler compared to traditional solutions which include registrations, KYC, complex integrations, and high transaction fees.

Unlike many other existing stable coins like USDT and USDC, we offer 100% transparency in accountings and a robust governance mechanism that shall be fully decentralized and run by an open community. We have also removed the unfair and unnecessary burden of the over-collateralization mechanism of assets for minting tokens as DAI does. Instead, we bring a fairer and robust protocol to maintain the pool stability.

The USDAO pool mechanism assures that the pool never gets undercollateralized and users are never threatened of forced liquidation. Above all, unlike its rivals, USDAO comes up with an ecosystem of use cases. The USDAO stable coin is one crucial element to the financial architecture we are building.

The details of such use cases are mentioned in the respective sections below. With the presence of USDAO on multiple blockchains and combining its interoperability and compatibility, it becomes a one-stop destination for truly decentralized robust, safe and secure financial solutions that are industry-ready. Before moving onto the USDAO workflow letâ€™s dive into some of its important and crucial components and terminologies. All prices are denominated in ether. These prices are computed by consulting ETH/USD price oracles, except when otherwise stated. Since the stable coin is deployed on multiple blockchains the keyword ERC20 is used in a general form. Every such statement is true for all the other protocols like BEP20 or TRC20 for Binance Smart Chain and Tron respectively.
