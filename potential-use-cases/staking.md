# Staking

Staking is the act of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards. It involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the security and operations of a blockchain network. Simple, staking is the act of locking cryptocurrency to receive rewards. Since every single USDAO token is a debt on the system we have to reduce the reward as the debt ratio rises to minimise the debt. This is the relationship between Debt ratio and Staking interest rate.
