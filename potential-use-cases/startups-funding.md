# Startups Funding

ICOs were a big deal back in 2017. It is a great concept but lacks security. However, since anybody could launch their own ICO with little technical knowledge, hundreds of untrusted and Ponzi schemes flooded the ICO market which soon became scams. With the vision to secure ICOs and uplift valuable startups with true potential, we intend to provide a trustless platform for both legitimate startups and global investors.
