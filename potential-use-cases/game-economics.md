# Game Economics

The concept of tokens and payments has existed even before the advent of stable coins. And as such there cannot be any better marriage of the blockchain and gaming industry as it not only makes the gaming experience safer but also trustless. More importantly, the true potential of using USDAO stable coin with games comes from the fact that more smart contracts can be developed on top of gaming logic integrating more complex yet rich gaming features using our stable coin.

A USDAO integration into a game shall provide an opportunity for trustless token economics including in-app purchases and asset transfers. In games that require trust, such as betting, users can participate honestly and with the assurance of fair gameplay.
