# Components & Terminologies

 **USDAO** is a two token protocol, both the tokens are linked with each other via smart contracts which powers the whole USDAO ecosystem. The Governance token helps in maintaining the protocol more decentralized.

### USDAO

This is the actual stable coin whose price is pegged relatively to 1 US dollar. It can be minted using either Ether or other specific ERC20 tokens. The amount of token minted depends upon the median ETH/USD price returned by the oracles used by the system at the time of the transaction.

### ASSET

The primary role of the ASSET token is to allow investors to fund the reserve pool with Ether and help USDAO maintain its price pegged to 1 US dollar regardless of any market fluctuations. The price of the ASSET token also varies proportionally to the Ether price.

## DAOGOV

DAOGOV Token is the Governance token of the protocol aimed to distribute governance rights/voting rights for USDAO ecosystem. DAOGOV can be acquired by participating in the sale of tokens or through or through a USDAO community campaign. The funds raised by the governance token \(DAOGOV\) , 100% of the raised amount would be shifted to stabilize the USDAO pool.
