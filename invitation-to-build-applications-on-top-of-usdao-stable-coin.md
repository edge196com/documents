# Invitation to build applications on top of USDAO stable coin

We are excited to inform the developer community that we would be regularly hosting several events like hackathons, seminars, and online tutorials to spread and share our knowledge with everyone. We are looking forward to seeing independent developers and programmers build applications on top of USDAO stable coin and amaze us with their solutions. In order to simplify the development process, we are developing a separate section for developers. The section will include necessary documentation, APIs list, widget integration, code examples, and everything relevant for further development.

We also host a platform to fund budding startups. A major part of the funding shall happen with the stable coin itself. We invite innovators and crazy minds from all around the world to share their ideas or applications built on top of our stable coin.

**We are ready to fund the next million-dollar idea.**
