# Decentralized Governance

Inspired by the Compound governance protocol, we developed a decentralized governance architecture that is aimed to serve as the sole decision-making body for future changes in the USDAO stable coin system. This is important to make USDAO protocol a completely decentralized system with no single individual or institution having full control over it.

Depending upon the changes we face in the future it is important to have features that allow necessary changes to be made for the welfare of the stable coin. However, when the world is moving towards complete decentralization we didnâ€™t want to be left behind.

Hence, we decided to build this decentralized governance system. We may decide to make the ASSET token the governance token. This is a subject of discussion currently.
