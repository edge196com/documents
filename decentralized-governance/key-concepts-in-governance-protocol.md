# Key concepts in governance protocol

### Governance Token

The governance token is an ERC20 token that is required to participate in governance protocol. Any individual or entity with governance tokens in their wallet can create, delegate or vote a proposal. The amount of governance tokens in the wallet determines the weight of the voting right of that individual. More the token the person has in his wallet, the more weightage he has in voting.

### Delegation

Mere owning of governance tokens does not allow the token holder to create or vote on a proposal. The token holder must first delegate his voting rights to either his own address or to someone else's address.

### Proposal <a id="proposal"></a>

A proposal is an executable code that, if run, would make the proposed changes in the functioning of the USDAO stable coin system. To create a proposal at least 1% of the governance token must be delegated to the proposerâ€™s address. A typical proposal consists of functions along with their parameters that get executed should the proposal succeed, Ether sent along with the proposal and a description regarding the purpose or motive behind the proposal. A proposal is subjected to a 3-day voting period after which it may or may not be accepted.

### Voting <a id="voting"></a>

People whose addresses have been delegated to vote for a proposal may choose to vote for or against a proposal. The votes can be cast only if the proposal is in an inactive state. Votes can be cast immediately by the cast vote feature or later using the castVoteBySig feature. There are a total of 10 million governance tokens. If a minimum of 4% of the total votes have participated and the majority of the votes cast are in favor of the proposal is queued in the timelock. If not, the proposal is rejected. The voting period is 3 days.

### Timelock <a id="timelock"></a>

Once a proposal is accepted it is not immediately executed. Rather it is queued in the timelock where it sits for the next 2 days. After 2 days, the proposal is executed and the changes can be observed publicly. This is important because the period of 2 days can be used by the community to notify the general users of USDAO stable coin about the incoming changes through various platforms. The proposals only get rescinded when they do not meet enough votes in their favor. We assure you that over a period of time the governance model will be truly decentralized and owned by a community of very learned and passionate people like you. The governance tokens shall also be distributed to our members building successful use cases for USDAO like startups and others. The foundation assures everyone to follow the best practices to build and maintain the USDAO community.
